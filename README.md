Lee's Feedback

Good work on this project. A couple of things to look at. 
  - Make sure that your nav bar is on every page
  - Have the links on your nav bar lead to the correct pages
  - Keep your style consistent across every page

This was a good effort and you have passed the class, but keep the suggestions above in mind.
